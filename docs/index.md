### About Open-Source

**Publishing the compiled JAR file of this plug-in directly and without my permission is not allowed!**

So if you want to make some changes to the codes, please consider `Pull Request` first!

### Build by yourself

Run commands below to build the project, make sure you have `Maven` installed on your computer before it.

By the way, if the `Building Passing` badge is shown as `FAILING`, you may probably not able to build by yourself right now.

git clone https://github.com/freeze-dolphin/UltimateGenerators/

cd UltimateGenerators/

mvn clean package
```
